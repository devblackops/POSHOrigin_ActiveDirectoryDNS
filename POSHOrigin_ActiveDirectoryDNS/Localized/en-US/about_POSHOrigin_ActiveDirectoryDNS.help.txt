LONG DESCRIPTION
    POSHOrigin_ActiveDirectoryDNS is a set of PowerShell 5 based DSC resources for
    managing Active Directory DNS objects via DSC. These resources are designed to 
    be used with POSHOrigin (https://github.com/devblackops/POSHOrigin) as a 
    Infrastructure as Code framework, but can be used natively by standard DSC 
    configurations as well. Integration with POSHOrigin is accomplished via a 
    separate 'Invoke.ps1' script included in the module.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    Resources
    ========================
    ARecord - Manages an A record
    CNAME - Manages a CNAME record   
    
    ARecord
    ========================
    Created, modifies, or deletes a A record object on an Active Directory DNS server.
    
    Parameters
    
    Name            Type	         Required  Description
    ================================================================================================
    Name            string	         True	   The hostname for the record
    Ensure	        string	         False	   Denotes if resource should exist or not exist
    DnsServer	    string           True	   The Active Directory DNS server to connect to
    Credential	    pscredential     True	   Credentials with rights to manage Active Directory 
                                               DNS records. In a POSHOrigin, credentials can be included 
                                               under the 'secrets' hashtable or defined inline
    IPAddress	    string	         True	   IPv4 address for A record
    ZoneName	    string	         True	   DNS zone the record is associated with
    TTL	            int	             False	   Time to live for A record
    CreatePtr	    bool	         False	   Indicates that the DNS server automatically creates an 
                                               associated pointer (PTR) resource record for an A record. 
                                               Default: True
    AllowUpdateAny	bool	         False	   Indicates that any authenticated user can update a resource 
                                               record that has the same owner name. Default: False
    AgeRecord	    bool	         False	   Indicates that the DNS server uses a time stamp for the 
                                               resource record that this cmdlet adds. A DNS server can 
                                               scavenge resource records that have become stale based on 
                                               a time stamp. Default value: False
                                               
    CName
    ========================
    Created, modifies, or deletes a CNAME record object on an Active Directory DNS server.
