# POSHOrigin_ActiveDirectoryDNS
POSHOrigin_ActiveDirectoryDNS is a set of PowerShell 5 based DSC resources for managing Active Directory DNS objects via DSC.

## Overview
POSHOrigin_ActiveDirectoryDNS is a set of PowerShell 5 based DSC resources for managing Active Directory DNS objects via DSC. These resources are designed to be used with [POSHOrigin](https://github.com/devblackops/POSHOrigin) as a Infrastructure as Code framework, but can be used natively by standard DSC configurations as well. Integration with [POSHOrigin](https://github.com/devblackops/POSHOrigin) is accomplished via a separate 'Invoke.ps1' script included in the module.

## Resources
* **ARecord** Manages an A record
* **CNAME** Manages a CNAME record
* **MX** manages an MX record

### ARecord

Created, modifies, or deletes a A record object on an Active Directory DNS server.

Parameters
----------

| Name            | Type         | Required | Description
| :---------------|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| Name            | string       | True     | The hostname for the record
| Ensure          | string       | False    | Denotes if resource should exist or not exist
| DnsServer       | string       | True     | The Active Directory DNS server to connect to
| Credential      | pscredential | True     | Credentials with rights to manage Active Directory DNS records. In a POSHOrigin, credentials can be included under the 'secrets' hashtable or defined inline
| IPAddress       | string       | True     | IPv4 address for A record
| ZoneName        | string       | True     | DNS zone the record is associated with
| TTL             | int          | False    | Time to live for A record
| CreatePtr       | bool         | False    | Indicates that the DNS server automatically creates an associated pointer (PTR) resource record for an A record. Default: True
| AllowUpdateAny  | bool         | False    | Indicates that any authenticated user can update a resource record that has the same owner name.. Default: False
| AgeRecord       | bool         | False    | Indicates that the DNS server uses a time stamp for the resource record that this cmdlet adds. A DNS server can scavenge resource records that have become stale based on a time stamp. Default value: False

### CName

Created, modifies, or deletes a CNAME record object on an Active Directory DNS server.

Parameters
----------

| Name            | Type         | Required | Description
| :---------------|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| Name            | string       | True     | The alias name for the record
| Ensure          | string       | False    | Denotes if resource should exist or not exist
| DnsServer       | string       | True     | The Active Directory DNS server to connect to
| Credential      | pscredential | True     | Credentials with rights to manage Active Directory DNS records. In a POSHOrigin, credentials can be included under the 'secrets' hashtable or defined inline
| FQDN            | string       | True     | Fully Qualified Domain Name the CNAME should point to
| ZoneName        | string       | True     | DNS zone the record is associated with
| TTL             | int          | False    | Time to live for A record
| AllowUpdateAny  | bool         | False    | Indicates that any authenticated user can update a resource record that has the same owner name.. Default: False
| AgeRecord       | bool         | False    | Indicates that the DNS server uses a time stamp for the resource record that this cmdlet adds. A DNS server can scavenge resource records that have become stale based on a time stamp. Default value: False

## POSHOrigin Example

This example shows how to use the **ARecord** resource within the context of a [POSHOrigin](https://github.com/devblackops/POSHOrigin) configuration file.

```PowerShell
resource 'POSHOrigin_ActiveDirectoryDNS:ARecord' 'serverxyz' @{
    ZoneName = 'mydomain.local'
    IpAddress = '10.45.195.254'
    DnsServer = 'dc01.mydomain.local'
    CreatePtr = $true
    Credential = Get-POSHOriginSecret 'pscredential' @{
        username = 'mydomain\administrator'
        password = 'K33p1t53cr3tK33p1t5@f3'
    }
}
```

## Traditional DSC example

This example show how to use the **ARecord** resource within a traditional DSC configuration file.

```PowerShell
Configuration Example_ARecord {
    param(
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost',

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$HostName,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$IPAddress,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$ZoneName,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$DnsServer,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [pscredential]$Credential,

        [int]$TTL,

        [bool]$CreatePtr,

        [bool]$AllowUpdateAny,

        [bool]$AgeRecord
    )

    Import-DscResource -Name ARecord -ModuleName POSHOrigin_ActiveDirectoryDNS

    Node $NodeName {
        ARecord "Create$HostName" {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Name = $HostName
            IPAddress = $IPAddress
            ZoneName = $ZoneName
            DnsServer = $DnsServer
            Credential = $Credential
            TTL = $TTL
            CreatePtr = $CreatePtr
            AllowUpdateAny = $AllowUpdateAny
            AgeRecord = $AgeRecord
        }
    }
}
```
